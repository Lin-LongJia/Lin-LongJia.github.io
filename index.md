My name is LongJia Lin.

I study Computer Science with emphasis on software developement. I enjoy being an engineer because it gives me the knowlege and courage to create the things I envision to be possible. I take joy in the challenges that comes along the way when you tapped into a new territory. Whether is learning softwares like Unity or the Unreal Enginge to enrich my proficiency at creating video games, or different types of programming languages such as Java, C/C++, and C# to get more grasp of Object Oriented Pattern. I am always seeking to be better! You may look at what I have achieve on [CV](https://lin-longjia.github.io/LongJia.pdf) section

Games in general is a big part of my life, so I spend a lot of times thinking about my experiences with the various games I have played. I post [blogs](https://lin-longjia.github.io/Blog/) to share my game design theories and design concepts of games I played. Using knowledge I learn from classes and books, in the blogs you may find me critique on game mechanics and give my own take on how to correctly implement it.

I also present you some of my [projects](https://lin-longjia.github.io/Project/), these are some fun projects that was made with a group of friends during the university years and some of my personal game projects during the summer and GamJams. I know the importance of leardership for someone to be the head or lead at something. I dream to lead a AAA game project therefore I also put a lot of effort on learning some fundamental drawings and modeling just to communicate my ideas better when presenting. Please check them out aswell at the [gallery](https://lin-longjia.github.io/Gallery/) section!
