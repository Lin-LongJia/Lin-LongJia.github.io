My name is LongJia Lin.

I study Computer Science with an emphasis on software development. I enjoy being an engineer because it gives me the knowledge and courage to create the things I envision to be possible. I take joy in the challenges that come along the way when you tapped into new territory. Whether is learning software like Unity or Unreal Engine to enrich my proficiency at creating video games, or different types of programming languages such as Java, C/C++, and C# to get more grasp of Object Oriented patterns. I am always seeking to be better! You may look at what I have achieved in the [CV](https://lin-longjia.github.io/LongJia.pdf) section

Games in general are a big part of my life, so I spend a lot of time thinking about my experiences with the various games I have played. I post [blogs](https://lin-longjia.github.io/Blog/) to share my game design theories and design concepts of games I played. Using the knowledge I learn from classes and books, in the blogs, you may find my critique on game mechanics and give my take on how to correctly implement it.

I also present to you some of my [projects](https://lin-longjia.github.io/Project/), these are some fun projects that were made with a group of friends during my university years and some of my game projects during the summer and GamJams. I know the importance of leadership for someone to be the head or lead at something. I dream to lead a AAA game project therefore I also put a lot of effort into learning some fundamental drawings and modeling just to communicate my ideas better when presenting. Please check them out as well in the [gallery](https://lin-longjia.github.io/Gallery/) section!
