This is an orginal concept model created and submitted as a final project for 3D modeling and Texturing class.
Tools I used include: 3ds Max, Mudbox, and MotionBuilder



### Design Inspiration

This is an orginal concept, with inspirations from many souces from Japanese Animation and Video Games

* Spider Man Miles Morales - with the suit and casual ware combo
* CyberPunk 2077 / CyberPunk Edge Runner - Color choices of bright Neon Green to create contrast of dark blue and black

### Modeling Process

1. 3ds Max
    1. Created a low poly character base, turbo smooth to create roundness
    2. Using Pull to extent a pants and a jacket 
    3. Rough edits on the pants and jacket
   
2. Mudbox
    1. Adding details to body, pants and jacket object using sculpt tool
    2. Using stencils and stamps to create specific texture

3. Return to 3ds Max
    1. Create a neat UV map by using the low retopologize from Mudbox

4. Return to Mudbox
    1. Paint body, pants, and jacket
    2. Create Diffuse Map, Normal Maps and Ambient Occlusion Maps
    3. Export a 360 turn table

5. Return to 3ds Max
    1. Assign bone and skin the chacter
    2. Export a 360 turn table for texture and wirefram

6. MotionBuilder
    1. Using MOCAP data fro mCarnegie Mellon University Motion Capture Database 
    2. Add actor to match the MOCAP data points
    3. Add character and rigged my model onto the character object
    4. Add physic compoent to clothing parts
    5. Export a final animation video
