![My project (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29043325/208524269-1f676031-226d-4115-b0ec-400b3cc6bf80.png)

This is a game project made with friends using the Unity Game Engine. This game uses Photon Networking Framework to achieve multiplayer capability.


This game has an additional emphasis on the horror genre, as the player spawns inside an enclosed building. The player has very limited visibility, thus requiring the player to manage their resources well and use the environment to provide lights to advance into the level.


The game has one creature model using NavMesh Agent and state machines to move throughout the level and chases the player when it is in certain proximity. The player also holds limited resources that both act as the game-winning condition and as defense mechanics.


Sound effects and UI decisions are designed to create more suspense and horror effect.
