![My project (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29043325/208524269-1f676031-226d-4115-b0ec-400b3cc6bf80.png)

This is a game project made with friends using Unity Game Engine. This game uses Photon Networking Framwork to achive mutiplayer capability.


This game has additional emphasis on the horror genera, as the player spawn inside of a enclosed builting. The player has very limited visibility, thus requires the player to manage their resources well and using the environment to provide lights to advance into the level.

The game has one creature model using NavMesh Agent and state machines to move throughout the level and chases the player when it is a certian proximity.
The player also holds limited resources that both act as the game winning condition and as a defense mechanics. 

Sound effect and UI decisions are designed to create more suspense and horror effect.
