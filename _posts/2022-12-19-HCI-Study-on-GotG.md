My deep analysis of game design choices that influenced the UI decision that hinders user experience and my interpretation how it should have been deigned

## Intro
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a game where you play as the team captin Peter Quill aka Star Lord. Fundamenatlly this game is less about how well you can control Star Lord, but rather using abilities of Star Lord and the crew to creat chaos in combat and solve puzzles to move onto the next scene.
Each character has 4 unique abilities you can cast after a specifc input sequence, with 4 side character you may execute their ability and a main character you can you, this is already pretty overwhelming. On top of this the game uses tradtional 3rd person action game with lock on/off mechanics to help the player shoot projectile and elemental shots. 
This game also feature diaglogue and decision choices throughout the story which may creat different sequence in future events. This feature was also added as an actual game mechanics called "Huddle" where you gather your crew mid combat to give a speech, depend on the choices it will buff your entire team or only yourself.

## Design Choices
