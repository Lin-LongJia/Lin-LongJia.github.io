Marvel is tackling the AAA market, it is the next generation's entertainment market 



## Marvel's

Without realizing it there is alredy series of "Marvel's" game on the AAA market. Although they are not totally connected, but it is already a franchise. 

Comparing to how the Assassin's Creed franchise can educate players about histories from the past, I believe the Marvel's franchise can entertain and retell the stories of the superheroes in their unique way. 

I say the Marvel's franchise will be the next generation's entertainment product because superhero and video games are very related. Let's start with this, why do people watch superhero movies, or specifically Marvel products in cinema or comic books? Ultimatly superhero stories are not the best way to create attatchments because you can not do the same thing they do in the movies.    

The ability to interact with the environment as the superhero is a powerful tool that differenicate a superhero game verse a superhero film. Additionaly with the aids the fact that films that already told their back story and events they have been through, even if the character we played may exist in a different universe, but we as the player do not forget what happens to them. This is very similar to how movies actually adopt from comic books, therefore when a film is announced we have a general back story already set. The fact that the back story is told once more as a film, it enhances its popularity and recognizability through visual and auditory. Video games goes beyond this by adding tacktile elements to it. 

One of the most successful game from the Marvel's franchise was Marvel's Spider-Man which released after the movie Spider-Man: Homecoming. The relase window was perfect as people awaits for the sequel after a successful cinematic Spider-Man remake. Marvel's Spider-Man did not disappoint either, the game capture the motions, swings, and the physics with quality and the game is very successful because of its relatability thorough interactions! Expample of this is having collectables scatter around the accurate recreation of Manhattan with activies like taking picture of landmarks and sightsees or finding old backpacks to unlock more suits and various challenges that encourages you to master the ability to be a Spider-man, swing. 

Other titles also do a great job at making the player more related to the character thorugh interactions. In Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, one of the core essence I feel after playing the game that I did not get from movies is the leadership role and characteristic of being the team captin as Star Lord. It is hard to get a sense of stress or fun being a part of a chaotic team through film, the game actually catpure it very well with selcetion dialogue suggesting to whether or not to throw Rocket across the cliff to gain access easier and the Huddle Up mechanic that capture the sense of leadership of Star Lord very well.

So far these gameplay experiences are only through a screen and a controller, image the future of the Marvel's franchise that adapts to new technology like virtual reality, playing as Iron Man through VR will be the ultimate experience.

Speaking of that the next Marvel's project is Iron Man, although possibly, we will never see a better Iron Man protrated through file or games because Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man is GOATed I believe it is possible for Marvel's Iron Man be a game that through interactions will make us more related to the character through game mechanics like Tony's dialogue with his AI and show his cockiness thorugh its gameplay. Just as Marvel's Spider-Man that may reminded you of Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire in film, I hope Marvel's Iron Man can do the same thing!
