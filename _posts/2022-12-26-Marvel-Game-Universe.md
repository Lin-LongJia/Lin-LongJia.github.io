Marvel is tackling the AAA market, it is the next generation's entertainment market 

## Marvel's

Without realizing it there is alredy series of "Marvel's" game on the AAA market. Although they are not totally connected, but it is already a franchise. 

Comparing to how the Assassin's Creed franchise can educate players about histories from the past, I believe the Marvel's franchise can entertain and retell the stories of the superheroes in their unique way. 

I say the Marvel's franchise will be the next generation's entertainment product because superhero and video games are very related. Let's start with this, why do people watch superhero movies, or specifically Marvel products in cinema or comic books? Ultimatly superhero stories are not the best way to create attatchments because you can not do the same thing they do in the movies.    

The ability to interact with the environment as the superhero is a powerful tool that differenicate a superhero game verse a superhero film. Additionaly with the aids the fact that films that already told their back story and events they have been through, even if the character we played may exist in a different universe, but we as the player do not forget what happens to them. This is very similar to how movies actually adopt from comic books, therefore when a film is announced we have a general back story already set. The fact that the back story is told once more as a film, it enhances its popularity and recognizability through visual and auditory. Video games goes beyond this by adding tacktile elements to it.
