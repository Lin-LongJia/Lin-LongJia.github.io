This is a 2 player platformer game made with friends using the Unity Game Engine. This game uses Photon Networking Framework to achieve multiplayer capability.



This game is a typical 2-player platformer Co-Op game where you must support your friend to proceed to the level in return your friend will do the same with the goal of both players reaching the end goal.

This game is my first experiment using the Photon Networking Framework, which I learn a lot of fundamentals about multiplayer games from. 
Examples such as synchronizing players' views, and platform movements. Photon synchronizes calls during update function or single function call.
